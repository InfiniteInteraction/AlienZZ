Shoot evil aliens with the right weapon (red plasma). Shoot good aliens with the left weapon (green plasma). It is like a shooting range, like archery, like a duel. It’s about pointing and aiming quickly. Aliens do not move. Just appear and disappear when shot. 

The player is not able to move.

Health is UI and will be displayed on the bottom left of the screen.

Enemies will turn from black to yellow at 3 seconds and yellow to red at 4 seconds. This is when the player starts taking damage. The enemies on screen do 20% damage each second they are not shot. Screen flashes red when taking damage.
